# find_orfs

This is a simple program that will find all ORFs in a fasta file with 1 or more sequences
## Requirements
* python 3.x
## Install
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/calvindo95/find_orfs.git
```
Change directory into repository:
```
cd find_orfs
```
## Usage
First make the script executable:
```
chmod +x main.py
```
Run the script: (this section does not include the cli yet)
```
./main.py
```
For some reason the last 2 steps don't work for me, so this is the current work-around to run the program:
```
python3 main.py <FASTA file input> <FASTA file output>
```
